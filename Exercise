SETTING UP GIT / GITHUB
=======================

Following:

https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

Assume git installed?
Assume github user exists?
Assume ssh / https authentication sorted?

For now at least, probably need to tackle these issues, at least in part, theoretically if not practically.

Suggests creation of git configuration directory in home directory?
Hmmm, maybe, I go for specific to a particular directory for now
Not sure, better if anyone using own laptop and doing an exercise though

I do:

Move into directory containing stuff

cd ; cd whatever
or 
cd ~/whatever

git config --global user.name "David Philip Judge"
git config --global user.email "david.p.judge@gmail"
git config --global credential.helper cache
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

Not sure where I got the last two lines? Need to look again at "man git"
Does not specify github? Continue regardless!


CREATE REPOSITORY SPECIFIC TO USER
==================================

https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/


CREATE INITIAL FORK:
====================
Create a local clone of your fork
---------------------------------

https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/


FILL NEW FORK AND SYNC WITH GITHUB
==================================

Put stuff in new fork directory

git remote -v

does nothing but confirm association with github repository, so safe, information only

pretty sure only need:

git remote add upstream

when sharing a project ... later!

SOCIAL???? --- BOLLOCKS!
========================

I want to push? Run out of instructions so I make it up and call it a day (2015.11.12)
Aha!! first:

git commit ..... yes I like my changes locally
git push .... stick changes onto github

Sleep!


2015.11.13
==========

Cannot push successfully??
Things getting a bit wild ... tried, amongst other things:

git config --global push.default simple

this removed tedious message when I do

git push

but no transfer?

Think combination

git add          ... add new files to what has to be processed
git commit       ... declares one is serious about changes
git push         ... pushes - except it does not?

should work?

git commit -a should do the first two commands together (-a ---> add)

does not seem to want to add empty directories by default?

OK ... commit requires a file called .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG to have all its lines uncommented???
WOT!!! surely not?

If one does edit the file ... whilst running git commit, using bloody nano (need to change!)
it works ... but this is just not practical for many many files surely!

2015.11.13
==========

Set up new repository for git stuff.
Attempt to avoid cul-de-sac this time.

1. Log into github
2. Make a new repository with a README file
3. Edit README file to add a few comments ... need to investigate here. What does it mean when it keeps asking me to be "on a fork"? What are the extended comments?
4 Move to directory to git and Initialise local git repository.

git config --global user.name "David Philip Judge"
git config --global user.email "david.p.judge@gmail"
git config --global credential.helper cache
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

5. Clone remote to local

git clone https://github.com/dpjudge/git_Material

Bugger! should bring down README file. Does not! Or .. yes it does but it takes down whole directory!
OK, so 4. should be:
move into directory to contain git repository ... then do I do all the initialisation stuff? ... probably, but only now I think?
So I do it  ... THEN read the manual. Yep, correct .. and even logical.

6. Tell git where the remote repository is ... though why it cannot work that out for itself I remain unsure?

git remote add upstream https://github.com/dpjudge/git_Material

do a few 

git remote -v

s. Looks good.

6. Now all that adding commiting and pushing stuff. After moving into place the things that need gitting.

git add .
git commit {noting could use -a)
git push
