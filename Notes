Best assume account already exists? Each student makes own project?
 
DPJ - 2015.10.11
================

Current situation
-----------------

2 accounts:

1)
cambioinfo: associated with 2 email addresses, dpj10@cam.ac.uk & pj237@cam.ac.uk
password is IudexRex1948

Must be official facility account? has a couple of repositories I made late 2014 plus
one active repository used by Mark Dunning for R Intro material

Other than trying to stop this being where I am logged into everytime I go to github (Done),
I think I leave this one alone. Password not for passing on! Should be changed. Discussed with Paul.

Treat as read only from here on.

2)
dpjudge: associated with just david.p.judge@gmail
password is IudexRex1948
name = David Philip Judge
email = david.p.judge@gmail

This is where I experiment.
--------------------

Running the commands in ~/GIT/Initialise_git_dpjudge
I reckon creates ~.gitconfig
ALmost certain, --global means "apply to all repositories", which implies some way to make the commands repository specific. Cannot see the need for th latter? Again, more thought here.

I suspect this only needs to be done once, assuming I always use only the one account.
--------------------

Authenticating with ssh and https also are (I think) one off activities (assuming one sticks to one account).

For ssh I followed
https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/#cloning-with-ssh
For http I followed
https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/#cloning-with-https-recommended

Should I introduce 2FA in a course context? I am inclined to at least mention it, Paul says no, which is no more than predictable. More thought required, well away from writing exercises now.

Extended Initialise_git_dpjudge to include the comands:
git config --global credential.helper cache
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
These added to ~/.gitconfig
They instruct the github password to be stored in cache for an hour to avoid having to type it in so often (default is 15 minutes, second command changes default).
I imagine .gitconfig is acted upon after first use of git?
